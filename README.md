## 1. ROS Multiple machines:

ROS Multi machine is based on TCP protocol and can establish connection between two computers.

**Step 1**:

Set first and second PC's IP addresses in same range.

As an example:

|**PC 1**|**PC 2**|  
|--- |--- |
| 192.168.YZ.NM   | 192.168.YZ.UX  |     

**Step 2**:

Remember that in ROS Multi machine,one machine will be known as host and $roscore usually runs on it.

So we should set some commands in both PC's `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` .

To get your IP you can use these commands:

```bash
$ hostname - I
```

```
$ ifconfig
```


|**PC 1 (Host)**|**PC 2**|
|---|---|
|`export ROS_IP=<IP 1>`|`export ROS_IP=<IP 2>`|
|`export ROS_HOSTNAME=<IP 1>`|`export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<IP 1>:11311`|
||`export ROS_HOSTNAME=<IP 2>`|

*NOTE: "You should run $roscore on HOST."* 


## 2. ROS parameters & Launch file:

**Step 1 ( Parametrs )**:

In addition to the messages that weâ€™ve studied so far, ROS provides another mechanism
called parameters to get information to nodes.

Very common method for setting parameters is to do so within a launch file.
Setting parameters
To ask roslaunch to set a parameter value, use a param element: 

```
<param name="param-name" type="variable" ,value="param-value" />
```

Then we shoud set it in our .cpp file.
```
nodehandle.param<std::string>("default_param", default_param, "default_value");
```
*NOTE: To define a private nodehandle you shoud define it like the example below:*
```
ros::NodeHandle nh("~");
```
If you want to get it:
```
ros::param::get("~private_name", param);
```

**Step 2 (Launch file)**:
```
<launch>
    <node pkg="package name" name="CPP File" type="package name" output = "screen">
    </node>

    <node pkg="package name" name="CPP File" type="package name" output = "screen" >
    </node>
</launch>
```
